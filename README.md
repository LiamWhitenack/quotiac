# TO DO

## Before Deployment

### Deactivate letters and icons which were given from hints

Also color them dark green

### Enable Sharing with popup menu

About 3 seconds after you solve the puzzle and the confetti is done you solve the puzzle, there should be a popup that shows your results (however that works) and has a button that lets you share them. In this menu there should also be anecdotal information about the puzzle, like in the case of a movie quote showing who said it and in what movie.

### When you remove a letter mapping, the active icon should move differently

it jumps around in a goofy way right now

### Next Quote Button

Should be temporary but for testing

### Deactivate hint button after finishing the puzzle

ez

## After first Deployment

### Dynamic Icon Sizing

Even if 32px is something we want to stick with on almost every occasion, we should be able to scale down the font size if the quote is too long to fit on the screen. Not a big deal regardless

### New hint types

Not sure where to store these. Maybe there would be a menu?

### Add some quotes and make a sustainable way of pulling up quotes

I doubt that we'll be able to make a new quote for every day, so we will need to reuse old quotes randomly, without using a quote that was just used.

### Create an admin mode

It would be nice to allow choosing new quotes and other helpful test features like activating hints or sharing or something

### Sizing, Sizing, Sizing

How does the game look on other phones? Is the keyboard too big or too small? What is the minimum size an encoded letter should be? How big and where should the menu buttons be? How does the website look on a desktop? Does it work well on androids?

I think it's safe to assume that my phone is the smallest phone that will be used. What if we're accessing the website on Safari? That allows even less usable space. Should we allow the user to switch to horizontal mode on mobile? If so, what happens with the now ridiculously oversized keyboard?
