# Deployment Version 1.0 Target Date: August 1st

## Needs

### 1. Make a new icon to use on the loading page and the browser and app icon

Use the native RN icons so that we can easily make animations and integrate the icon within the app.

### 2. Get 1 Month of Quotes Ready Starting With The Deployment Date

We can use random quotes or reuse quotes until then

## Wants

### Fix: keyboard arrows not working anymore

### Fix: iOS content restrictions

Contacted apple developer support, they started a case for me: 102657142717

### Add New Hint Types

### Scrape the living heck out of IMDB's movie quotes

The best method is probably to get a list of the 10,000 most popular movies/shows on IMDB, go to their quote sections, and download all of those. All without getting blocked.

### Sizing Concerns

The size of the icon container seems to be fallible. A better way of calculating its size needs to be implemented before the app is perfect

### Get (Someone With a) Mac To Let Us Deploy On Their Device
