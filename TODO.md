# Deployment Version 1 Date: August 1st

## Needs

### Add a Tutorial

### Add Room for More Puzzle Info

Like a hint. For instance, a hint for a Finding Nemo quote could be "Name's Bruce :D"

### Get 1 Month of Quotes Ready Starting With The Deployment Date

We can use random quotes or reuse quotes until then

### Finishing the puzzle should let you see the details of the puzzle in the finished modal

Not just by pressing the button in the top left

## Wants

### Scrape the living heck out of IMDB's movie quotes

The best method is probably to get a list of the 10,000 most popular movies/shows on IMDB, go to their quote sections, and download all of those. All without getting blocked.

### Sizing Concerns

The size of the icon container seems to be fallible. A better way of calculating its size needs to be implemented before the app is perfect
